# JavaScript Journey 🚀

This repository contains my JavaScript learning journey as I prepare to build full-stack MERN applications.

I am learning JavaScript fundamentals deeply to strengthen my frontend and backend (Node.js) development skills.

## 🎯 Goal

To build strong JavaScript fundamentals and apply them in:

- React (Frontend)
- Node.js & Express (Backend)
- MongoDB integration
- Full MERN Stack Projects

## 🛠 Why This Repo?

Instead of just watching tutorials, I:
- Write code daily
- Practice small problems
- Build mini projects
- Document my learning publicly
